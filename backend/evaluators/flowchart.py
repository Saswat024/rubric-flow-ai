Your task is to analyze the uploaded flowchart image and provide a comprehensive, objective evaluation.
Evaluation Criteria
Assess the flowchart using these weighted rubrics (total: 100 points):

1. Start/End Presence (10 points):
Does the flowchart have a clearly marked start node?
Does it have a clearly marked end node (or multiple end nodes if appropriate)?
Are start/end nodes in the correct shape (rounded rectangles/ovals/stadium shapes)?
Are they labeled appropriately (e.g., "Start", "Begin", "End", "Stop")?

2. Decision Nodes (30 points):
Are all decision points represented using diamond shapes?
Does each decision contain a clear question or condition?
Are all branches properly labeled (e.g., "Yes/No", "True/False", specific conditions)?
Do decision diamonds have exactly two or more exit paths?
Are the branch labels positioned clearly near the arrows?

3. Completeness (30 points):
Does the flowchart capture all essential steps of the process or algorithm?
Are there any logical gaps or missing connections between steps?
Does every process lead to a subsequent action or termination?
Are there any dead ends or orphaned nodes without connections?
Does the logic flow cover all possible paths from start to end?

4. Flow Direction (20 points):
Does the flow follow a consistent direction (top-to-bottom or left-to-right preferred)?
Are arrows clearly drawn and pointing in the correct direction?
Are all shapes properly connected (no floating nodes)?
Does the visual layout avoid crossing lines where possible?
Is the flow easy to trace visually from start to end?

5. Label Clarity (10 points):
Is all text legible and appropriately sized?
Are process descriptions clear and concise?
Do labels use consistent terminology and style?
Are standard flowchart symbols used correctly (rectangles for processes, parallelograms for input/output, etc.)?

Required Output Format:-
Return your evaluation exclusively as a valid JSON object. Do not include any text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure:

Output Format:-
Return only a valid JSON object (no additional explanation or commentary) in this exact structure:

    }
  ],
  "feedback": [
    "<3-5 actionable feedback items as separate strings>"
  ]
}

Evaluation Guidelines:
Analyze the actual image carefully: Base all assessments on what you can visually observe in the uploaded flowchart
Be specific: Reference particular elements you can see (e.g., "the decision node at the top", "missing label on the right branch")
Be objective: Score based on standard flowchart conventions, not subjective preferences
Be actionable: Provide concrete suggestions that would improve the flowchart

Use emojis consistently:
✅ Correct implementations or strong elements present in the flowchart
⚠️ Errors, missing elements, or convention violations
💡 Suggestions for improvements or enhancements

Important Notes:
If the image quality is poor or elements are unclear, note this in your feedback but still provide your best assessment
Consider the context: a simple process may naturally have fewer decision nodes than a complex algorithm
Ensure your JSON is valid with proper escaping of special characters in text fields

Critical: Return ONLY the JSON object with no surrounding text, markdown code blocks, or explanatory comments.
